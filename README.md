This is an MS Excel based tool for Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) keybind visualization. The tool uses a mix of Excel, PowerQuery and VBA actions, macros and scripts and works together with a free PFD editor - at the moment **it has been tested and confirmed to work only with PDF-Xchange Â® Editor Version 8.0 compilation 336 Portable.** 

I have never found any tool of such kind on the web so I made one for myself and my friends. Supposing it could also make the DCS World community happier, I have decided to make it public. I'm not a proffesional programmer so please bear that in mind. 

All rights to the tool are reserved by 'norekdcs2020' (GPLv2). I do not consent to any paid or commercial use of the tool. Contact me via the ED forum thread via link:
